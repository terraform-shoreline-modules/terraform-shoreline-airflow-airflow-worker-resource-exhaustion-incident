  "description": "This incident type refers to situations where Apache Airflow workers have exhausted their resources. Apache Airflow is an open-source platform to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows. Workers in Apache Airflow are responsible for executing tasks and are essential to the platform's functionality. Resource exhaustion in workers can cause a significant impact on the performance of the platform and can result in workflow failures. This incident type requires immediate attention to ensure the workers have sufficient resources to execute tasks, and the platform is functioning correctly.",
